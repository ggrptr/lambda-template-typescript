A simple hello world AWS Lambda function written in TypeScript, to use as a template for my projects.
It contains the tools I use to develop, test and deploy my TS lambda functions.

The list and explanation of the scripts in the `package.json` :

-   prepare: at the first running of npm, this hook will automatically install the husky hooks.
    [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is a tool for executing commands on git hooks.
-   start: builds and runs the code locally
-   build: builds the code
-   build:prod: builds the code with production settings (using the `tsconfig.prod.json` config file)
-   lint: runs eslint with --fix option, to check linting errors and fix them
-   format: formats the code with prettier
-   spell: find spelling errors in the code, based on the configuration in cspell.json
-   test: runs [jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests without any arguments
-   test:debug: runs all test serially with the current process, for debugging purposes
-   test:coverage: like test:debug, but with generating coverage report
-   test:watch: runs jest in watch mode, to re-run tests on file changes
-   package:modules: creates a lambda layer package from the node_modules directory
-   package:src : creates a lambda package from the src directory
-   package: calls package:modules and package:src to create a full lambda deployment package

It's a bit complicated to separate the local and deployment build (especially the node_modules directory),
but it's necessary if I want to use the same local project for local development and test terraform deployments.
